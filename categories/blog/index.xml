      <description>Once I faced a problem - &amp;ldquo;How can I create a normal window on Mac OS?&amp;quot;. Definitely it is possible to use XCode, generate new project using very modern tools and start writing events handling functions/callbacks/delegates/etc. But what if I want to do everything by hand, for example last by wrinting some code using latest available version of Swift. And here I faced a problem - there are no simple step-by-step guide which will explain how to do it.</description>

      <description>So, I want to Welcome everybody who at any circumstances get to this page.
Recently I decided that it will be great at least to save some random things that I found interesting but also try to share it cause I strongly believe that if something become interesting to one person then this person is not alone and there is non zero probability that there is somebody else who can be interested in it.</description>

        <div

          Problem: You have two slices that potentially share same memory buffer meaning that appending to one can cause changes in another one. So how to understand if two slices are actually share memory?
Let&rsquo;s imagine we have a functions like:
func IsMemoryShared(a, b []int) bool { ... }  And we want to preserve following behaviour:
a := []{1, 2, 3} b := []{1, 2, 3} IsMemoryShared(a, a) // true IsMemoryShared(a[:2]) // true IsMemoryShared(a, b) // false IsMemoryShared(a[1:0], b[1:0]) // false  It is known that slice in Go backed by a struct that contain a pointer to some place in memory where slice data is stored and two integers - length and capacity of the slice.

          Once I face a problem - &ldquo;How can I create a normal window on Mac OS?&rdquo;. Definitely it is possible to use XCode, generate new project using very modern tools and start writing events handling functions/callbacks/delegates/etc. But what if I want to do everything using code, for example last available version of Swift. And here I faced a problem cause there are no normal step-by-step guides which will explain how to do it.

      <p>So, I want to Welcome everybody who at any circumstances get to this page.</p>
<p>Recently I decided that it will be great at least to save some random things that I found interesting but also try to share it cause I strongly believe that if something become interesting to one person then this person is not alone and there is non zero probability that there is somebody else who can be interested in it. Will see how it goes during the time.</p>
<p>Some technical stuff related to this Blog: main &ldquo;content generation&rdquo; software I use for doing this blog posts is <a href="https://gohugo.io"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Hugo</a> preconfigured with one of the minimalistic templates called <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-classic/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >hugo-classic</a>. It&rsquo;s my first test of Hugo and it looks very good, very simple to use and just start writing some texts. At some point of time I will create own personal theme maybe based on something but currently I don&rsquo;t want to spend time on this.</p>
